I have a weird <i title="It's not much of a theory since it cannot be refuted but I don't know any better term for it">"theory"</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
Take two objects and place them near one another,
<b>the closer</b> and <b>the more reagent</b> they are the more likely they are to show similar properties.
  </p>
  <p>
In other words they start <i title="I chose the copying word somewhat arbitrarily here but, my reasoning is that it makes sense from my human perspective">"copying"</i> each other.
  </p>
  <p>
This works for anything that's affected by <b>entropy</b>: animals, plants, inanimate objects and even thoughts and ideas.
  </p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place two objects together and they start exchanging atoms, charge etc, becoming more similar in time.
  </li>
  <li>Put two animals together and they start communicating eventually responding similarly in their behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
Place two people together, and their behaviour and thoughts, <b>for better or worse</b>, start mimicking each other.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This also happens for <i title="I'm using genes pretty broadly here. You can interpret it as inheritable phisical characteristics">"genes"</i>:
If two species of plants stay next to one another, being placed under similar environmental they will start showing evolutionary convergence.
<p>And of course retroviruses make even possible to make the genes more similar across species.
</p>
</p>

<p>I think it's like a different perspective to entropy itself.
</p>

<p>
The common interpretation for entropy is that all things lead to disorder. But if you think of it from this perspective it also seems that entropy can also be imagined a property of things that lead them to exchange traits with their surroundings. Eventually all things become so similar that it's impossible to differentiate them. ie: They reach their maxium entropy.
</p>
<p>
Of course things get <b>a lot</b> more complicated when you talk about behavior of "active" agents
like animals and humans. It's hard to say that's entropy that cause people to think similarly across continents even when they haven't met, but the phenomena is there, only the explanation is missing.
</p>

<p>
  My takeaway is simply that, from our perspective nature likes to make copies of things, the mechanisms that are employed to that can vary greatly but from our perspective the result is the same.
</p>
<p>
I haven't yet come up with any use for that but <i title="And there's no way in hell that I'm going to expand on that in this text so you just gotta take my word for it.">I think it could help explain the abiogenesis theory.</i>
  </p>

  <p>Looking around I wasn't able to find other studies that went in this direction. If you know anything about it, please let me know.
